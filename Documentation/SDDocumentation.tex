\section{Deliverable 1}
    \subsection{Project Specification}
    Macro Buddy is a calorie tracking application designed to help users monitor their nutritional intake and achieve their dietary goals. The system allows users to track their daily food consumption by recording entries in a personal journal, organized by date and meal type. \\

    The application is built using Java Spring framework with a PostgreSQL database for data persistence, containerized using Docker. The current implementation includes a mock frontend developed with Java Swing, following the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern. \\

    Macro Buddy supports two types of users: regular users and administrators. Regular users can manage their personal food entries and customize their nutritional goals, while administrators have additional privileges to create and manage the food database accessible to all users.

    \newpage
    \subsection{Supplementary Specifiaction}

        \subsubsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
        \textbf{1. Security}

        The system must securely store user credentials and personal data. Passwords must be stored using cryptographic hashing algorithms. Access to user journals and personal data must be restricted to the respective users only. Administrator privileges must be strictly controlled. \\

        This requirement is suitable for implementation because:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Nutritional tracking applications contain sensitive personal health information
            \item Spring Security framework provides robust and easy to use security features
        \end{itemize}

        \textbf{2. Usability}

        The user interface must be intuitive and require minimal training. Common tasks should be accomplishable in three clicks or less. The system must provide meaningful feedback for user actions and clear error messages when needed.  \\

        This requirement is suitable for implementation because:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Daily use applications must have low friction to encourage consistent use
            \item Java Swing allows for fast development of clean and intuitive interfaces
        \end{itemize}

        \textbf{3. Performance}

        The system must be highly respond to user input under normal operating conditions. The application must operate efficiently with at least 100 concurrent users, with minimal overhead on the users. \\

        This requirement is suitable for implementation because:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Response time directly usability
            \item Spring and PostgreSQL can be configured for high performance
            \item Database indexing and query optimization can be implemented
        \end{itemize}

        \textbf{4. Maintainability}

        The codebase must follow object-oriented design principles and established design patterns. The system architecture must support future extension of features without major refactoring. \\

        This requirement is suitable for implementation because:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The current package structure already supports separation of concerns
            \item Service-oriented architecture allows for modular development
            \item Unit tests provide a foundation for sustainable maintenance
            \item Java Spring supports extensible application design
        \end{itemize}

        \subsubsection{Design Constraints}
        \textbf{Technology Stack}

        The system must be implemented using Java Spring framework for the backend services and PostgreSQL for data persistence. The current implementation requires Java Swing for the frontend interface. \\

        \textbf{Architectural Patterns}

        The backend must implement a layered architecture with clear separation between controllers, services, and repositories. This ensures maintainability and supports potential future migration to a web-based interface. \\

        \textbf{Development Process}

        Development must follow test-driven development practices, with unit tests required for all service classes. Mockito and JUnit Jupiter are the preferred testing frameworks. \\

        \textbf{Deployment Environment}

        The database must be containerized using Docker to ensure consistent development and deployment environments. The application must be configurable to connect to either a local or remote PostgreSQL instance. \\

\section{Deliverable 2}
    \subsection{Domain Model}
        \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{domain_model.png}
        \caption{Macro Buddy Domain Model}
        \end{figure}

        The domain model illustrates the core entities of the system:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{User}: Represents application users with authentication information and role designation (regular user or administrator).
            \item \textbf{UserSettings}: Contains the nutritional goals and other settings for a specific user.
            \item \textbf{Food}: Represents food items in the database with their nutritional information.
            \item \textbf{Entry}: Represents a food consumption record in a user's journal.
        \end{itemize}

        Key relationships:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Each User has exactly one UserSettings profile.
            \item A User can have multiple Entry records (their food journal).
            \item Each Entry references exactly one Food item.
        \end{itemize}


    \subsection{Architectural Design}
        \subsubsection{Conceptual Architecture}
            The application implements client-server architecture with separation between the frontend and backend components. The backend follows a layered architecture pattern, while the frontend implements its own React-based architectural pattern. Together, they form a comprehensive web application with a React TypeScript frontend and a Java Spring RESTful API backend.

            \begin{figure}[h]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{conceptual_architecture}
            \caption{Conceptual Architecture}
            \end{figure}

            \newpage
            \textbf{Architectural Style Justification}:

            The client-server architecture with layered backend was chosen for the following reasons:

            \begin{enumerate}
                \item \textbf{Clear Separation of Concerns}: The architecture separates the frontend (React) from the backend (Spring) with a well-defined REST API interface between them. Within each part, there are further separations (UI components/services in frontend, controllers/services/repositories in backend).

                \item \textbf{Enhanced Security}: The architecture implements modern security practices with JWT for stateless authentication, CSRF protection for request verification, and secure password encryption.

                \item \textbf{Maintainability and Testability}: Each layer has clear responsibilities, making it easier to test components in isolation and update specific parts without affecting the entire system.
            \end{enumerate}

            The use of DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) and Mappers further enhances the architecture by:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Providing a clear contract between frontend and backend
                \item Protecting internal domain objects from direct exposure
                \item Allowing for different representations of the same data for different use cases
            \end{itemize}
        \subsubsection{Package Design}
            The package structure reflects the layered architecture and organizes code by technical responsibility.

            \begin{figure}[h]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{package_diagram}
            \caption{Package Diagram}
            \end{figure}

            The package design follows a clear dependency direction, where higher-level packages (controller) depend on lower-level packages (service, repository), maintaining the layered architecture principles:

            \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{config}: Contains application configuration for security features (JWT, CSRF, password encryption)
            \item \textbf{controller}: REST API endpoints that handle HTTP requests and responses
            \item \textbf{service}: Business logic implementation
            \item \textbf{repo}: Data access layer for interacting with the database
            \item \textbf{entity}: JPA entity classes that map to database tables
            \item \textbf{mapper}: Converts between entities and DTOs
            \item \textbf{request/response}: DTOs for API input and output
            \end{itemize}

        \subsubsection{Component and Deployment Diagram}
            The component and deployment diagrams illustrate the runtime architecture and physical deployment structure of the system.

            \begin{figure}[h]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{component_diagram}
            \caption{Component Diagram}
            \end{figure}

            \begin{figure}[h]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{deployment_diagram}
            \caption{Deployment Diagram}
            \end{figure}

            The component diagram shows the internal structure of the application with a focus on the logical components and their interactions, while the deployment diagram illustrates how these components are distributed across physical hardware or containerized environments.

            Key aspects of the deployment architecture:

            \begin{itemize}
                \item The frontend is a TypeScript React web application loaded in the client's browser.
                \item Static content (compiled React code) is served via a web server or CDN for optimal performance.
                \item The Spring Boot backend provides secure REST API endpoints with JWT authentication and CSRF protection.
                \item Business logic is implemented in the service layer, with clear separation from the data access layer.
                \item The PostgreSQL database runs in a Docker container for consistency across development and production environments.
                \item All client-server communication occurs via HTTP/S using RESTful conventions.
            \end{itemize}

\section{Deliverable 3}
    \subsection{Design Model}
        \subsubsection{Dynamic behavior}
            \textbf{Sequence Diagram: Adding a Food Entry}\\
            The sequence diagram illustrates the process of a user adding a food entry to their journal, showcasing the interactions between the frontend components and backend services.

            \begin{figure}[h]

            \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{sequence_1}
            \caption{Sequence Diagram}

            \newpage
            \textbf{Communication Diagram: Creating a New Food}\\
            The communication diagram illustrates the process of an admin creating a new food. It shows the transformation between DTOs and entity objects, and demonstrates the separation of the services.

            \begin{figure}[h]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{communication}
            \caption{Communication Diagram}
            \end{figure}

        \subsubsection{Class Diagram}
            The following class diagrams illustrate the structure of the Macro Buddy application.

            \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{class_config}
            \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{class_controller}

            \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{class_entity}
            \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{class_repo}


            \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{class_service}

            The class diagram incorporates several Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns to enhance the application's architecture:

            \begin{enumerate}
                \item \textbf{Strategy Pattern}: The service interfaces (UserService, FoodService, EntryService) with their implementations (UserServiceImpl, FoodServiceImpl, EntryServiceImpl) demonstrate the Strategy pattern. This allows for different implementations of the same interface, making the system more flexible and testable.

                \item \textbf{Factory Method Pattern}: The JWT token provider uses the Factory Method pattern to create authentication tokens, encapsulating the token creation logic within a specialized class.

                \item \textbf{Singleton Pattern}: The SecurityConfig and other configuration classes are implemented as Spring @Configuration beans, which are effectively singletons managed by the Spring container.

                \item \textbf{Adapter Pattern}: The Mapper classes (not fully shown) implement the Adapter pattern by converting between DTOs and entity objects, bridging the gap between the presentation layer and the domain model.

                \item \textbf{Facade Pattern}: The service layer acts as a facade to the underlying repository operations, providing a simplified interface to the controllers and hiding the complexity of data access and business logic.
            \end{enumerate}

            These design patterns were used to promote separation of concerns, enhance maintainability, and  improve testability. The Strategy pattern, in particular, facilitates mock implementations for testing, while the Adapter pattern ensures that the internal domain model remains decoupled from the external API representation.
            \newpage
        \subsection{Data Model}
            The data model for Macro Buddy is implemented using JPA entities mapped to PostgreSQL tables. The following diagram illustrates the relational database schema:

            \begin{figure}[h]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{data_model}
            \caption{Data Model}
            \end{figure}

            The database schema is designed with the following considerations:

            \begin{enumerate}
                \item \textbf{Normalization}: The schema follows normal form conventions to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity.

                \item \textbf{Constraints}:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity
                    \item Unique constraints on username and email prevent duplicates
                    \item Check constraints ensure that nutritional values are non-negative
                \end{itemize}

            \end{enumerate}

            \paragraph{JPA Implementation}

            The Java entities are mapped to this schema using JPA annotations:

            \begin{itemize}
                \item @Entity, @Table annotations map classes to database tables
                \item @Id, @GeneratedValue define primary keys and their generation strategy
                \item @Column specifies column details including constraints
                \item @ManyToOne, @OneToMany, @OneToOne establish entity relationships
                \item @JoinColumn defines foreign key columns
                \item @Enumerated maps Java enums to database columns
            \end{itemize}

            Hibernate is configured to automatically validate the schema against the entity definitions during application startup, ensuring consistency between the code and database schema.

    \subsection{System Testing}
            The testing strategy for Macro Buddy encompasses multiple testing levels to ensure the application's quality, reliability, and security. The following approach is implemented:
